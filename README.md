# Reinforcement Learning Finds Effective Strategy for Polyhedral Offsets

This repository provides the datasets for the experiments of the paper <em>"Reinforcement Learning Finds Effective Strategy for Polyhedral Offsets"</em>, submitted to <em>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</em> (NeurIPS 2025) [[1]](#1).

We appreciate your understanding that the source code necessary for reproducing the experiments cannot be made public at this time to maintain anonymity. The code will be provided once the paper is accepted.

## Sources
 
The file naming convention in the directories `data/polyhedra/training`, `data/polyhedra/validation` and `data/polyhedra/test` follows the format `<source> <title> @<owner>.stl`, where `<source>` stands for the source from which the polyhedral object with the title `<title>` owned by `<owner>` was taken. For `<source>`, there are `cults` [[2]](#2), `thingiverse` [[3]](#3) and `sketchfab` [[4]](#4). All used objects are subject to Creative Commons licenses and were downloaded from the respective websites on October 6, 2023.

The name of each file in the directory `data/polyhedra/thingi10k` corresponds to the model number of the respective object from the Thingi10K database [[5]](#5). All objects were downloaded from [[6]](#6) on February 14, 2025.
